		<h> Roasting and Gasping in Pac NW; All-Time Record Heat in Southeast Europe </h>

		<p>During the first three days of August, some locations in the Pacific Northwest have approached their hottest temperatures ever recorded—and parts of southeast Europe have seen all-time highs. More brutally hot days lie ahead, as residents endure a multi-day heat wave that ranks among the worst on record for both regions (even as the central and eastern U.S. enjoys an unusually mild first week of August).Western Oregon has been the epicenter of this week’s exceptional Northwest heat. On Thursday, Portland, OR, soared to 105°F. Only five days in Portland’s history have been hotter, most recently 106°F on July 28 and 29, 2009.  Medford hit 112°F on Wednesday, a temperature last seen in August 1981 and not far from Medford’s all-time high of 115°F. “Last time we saw heat like this, postage stamps were 20 cents,” noted the NWS office in Medford. The state capitol of Salem came just a degree short of its all-time high on Wednesday, hitting 107°F.Plenty of daily record highs also fell by the wayside from central California to western Washington, though the heat wasn’t quite so impressive on either side of Oregon. Seattle hit 94°F on Thursday, breaking the daily record of 91°F set in 1939. The pace of record-setting will gradually lessen over the next several days, as low-level flow near the Pacific Coast takes on more of an onshore component. On the down side, mid-level moisture will increase, which sets the stage for an increase in “dry” thunderstorms that could trigger wildfires. The fire weather outlook issued Thursday afternoon by the NOAA/NWS Storm Prediction Center highlights a dry-thunderstorm risk across most of the Pacific Northwest from Saturday through Wednesday.</p>

Image credit: AP Photo/Don Ryan.A strong tropical wave that emerged from the coast of Africa on Wednesday was located about 500 miles southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands on Thursday morning, and was headed west to west-northwest at 10 – 15 mph. This system was designated 99L by the National Hurricane Center on Thursday morning, and has a greater potential to become a hurricane than the large majority of the Atlantic disturbances we’ve seen so far this year. However, 99L is expected to struggle with dry air next week, and could easily fizzle out.

99L was under moderate wind shear of 10 – 15 knots on Thursday morning, and had ocean temperatures adequate for development: 27.5 - 28°C (81 - 82°F). The dry air of the Saharan Air Layer was to the north of the wave, but not close enough to seriously impede development. Relative humidity at mid-levels of the atmosphere as analyzed by the 12Z Thursday run of the SHIPS model was high--about 75%. Satellite loops showed that 99L had impressive size, a good deal of spin, and low-level spiral bands already beginning to appear. An ASCAT pass at 6:36 am EDT Thursday showed that 99L had a closed (but elongated) surface circulation centered near 8.5°N, 20°W, with top winds of about 25 mph in the heavy thunderstorms to the northeast of the center. This position is close enough to the equator that 99L will have trouble leveraging the Earth's spin to help get itself spinning over the next few days..</p>
